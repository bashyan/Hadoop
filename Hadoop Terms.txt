	the slave datanode sends heartbeat signal for every 3 sec(reconfigurable) that its alive.

X. what is heartbeat.
	-Heartbeats in HDFS are the signals that are sent by DataNodes to the NameNode to indicate 
	that it is functioning properly (alive). By default, the heartbeat interval is 3 seconds, 
	which can be configured using dfs.heartbeat.interval in hdfs-site.xml.

6. what is checkpoint.
