1. what is file system.
	-to store data, retrieve data, arrange data, remove data.
	File system is an area which is provided by any environment to manage the data 
	in the form of files. eg: Files/Directory.

2. what is HDFS.
	- focused on storage part of data in efficient and reliable way.
	- stores the data in the form of data blocks having size 128MB.
	- it support fault tolerance with the help of replication factor.
	- streaming access to file system data.
	- write once read any number of time.

3. what is diff btw data block and split.
	storage				computing
	HDFS				YARN
	block				split

4. what is commodity hardware.
	- low cost compared to RDBMS servers.
	- its a server with less capacity. 

5. what is namenode.
	- its the masternode of hdfs, it maintains the info of all datanode in metadata bin file,
	the slave datanode sends heartbeat signal for every 3 sec(reconfigurable) that its alive.

X. what is heartbeat.
	-Heartbeats in HDFS are the signals that are sent by DataNodes to the NameNode to indicate 
	that it is functioning properly (alive). By default, the heartbeat interval is 3 seconds, 
	which can be configured using dfs.heartbeat.interval in hdfs-site.xml.

6. what is checkpoint.

7. explain rack awareness.
	node- any commodity h/w which is used to store the data.
	rack-  it is collection of 30-40 node which is connected via hdfs
	- fault tolerance and high availabilty of data, performance. one of the replica should be in diff node out of
	all replicas. and no more than 2 replica in same rack

8. explain the replication process.

9. what happens when a new block is created.
	first replica will be placed on the local node. second replica will be placed on the next local node, third 
	replica will be placed in next local rack.
